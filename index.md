Hello! I'm Seraphina Fong (邝美玉), a PhD student in Information Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Trento, Italy and within the [SpeechTek Lab](https://speechtek.fbk.eu/) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). 

Broadly speaking, my research focuses on multilingual and multimodal speech technology. Addressing the unique challenges of low-resource scenarios is one significant focus within this broader scope, driven by an interest in accessible and inclusive technology. 

I am supervised by Dr. [Alessio Brutti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dS643iQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Marco Matassoni](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=-3HUNjEAAAAJ&hl=en).

      - title: **October 2023**: I graduated with honours and obtained a M.Sc. in Cognitive Science from the the University of Trento, Italy. My thesis focused on investigating the feasibility of speaker-independent deep learning voice conversion approaches (e.g., [StarGAN](https://github.com/liusongxiang/StarGAN-Voice-Conversion), [PPG-VC](https://github.com/liusongxiang/ppg-vc)) to improve speech from English speaking [patients with dysarthria](http://www.isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/UASpeech/index.html). I was supervised by [Dr. Alessio Brutti](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=dS643iQAAAAJ&hl=en) (FBK) and [Professor Gianluca Esposito](https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=ehhpFjQAAAAJ) (Uni Trento).
      - title: **August 2023**: I attended the [12th ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop](https://ssw2023.org/) in Grenoble, France. Preliminary results from my master's thesis were accepted as a [late-breaking report](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/ssw_2023/fong23b_ssw.html) and presented as a poster at the workshop.
      - title: **September 2022 - October 2023**: I was a research intern at the [Speech Technology Lab](https://speechtek.fbk.eu/) at the Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK).

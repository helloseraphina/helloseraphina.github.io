- July 2025: We at the FBK SpeechTek lab release a HuggingFace collection of pre-trained multilingual speechLLM projectors that can be downloaded and used for further fine-tuning or decoding. More information <a href='https://huggingface.co/collections/SpeechTek/meultilingual-speechllm-projectors-686fb4497e6c97d89ea315a8'>here!</a>. 

- May 2025: My first first-author paper as a PhD student has been accepted at Interspeech 2025! In our paper titled "Speech LLMs in Low-Resource Scenarios: Data Volume Requirements and the Impact of Pretraining on High-Resource Languages", we systematically investigate how much training data is needed for a SpeechLLM linear projector to be comparable to a Whisper-only setup. We then show that pretraining these projectors on high-resource languages can effectively mitigate performance issues typically associated with data scarcity. More details to be shared later on! 

- November 2024: I started my PhD in Information Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. I am supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=dS643iQAAAAJ&hl=en'>Alessio Brutti</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=-3HUNjEAAAAJ&hl=en'>Marco Matassoni</a>, and work within the <a href='https://speechtek.fbk.eu/'>SpeechTek lab</a>.
  
- October 2023: I graduated with honours and obtained a M.Sc. in Cognitive Science from the the University of Trento, Italy. My thesis focused on investigating the feasibility of speaker-independent deep learning voice conversion approaches to improve speech from English speaking <a href='http://www.isle.illinois.edu/sst/data/UASpeech/index.html'>patients with dysarthria</a>. I was supervised by <a href='https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=dS643iQAAAAJ&hl=en'>Dr. Alessio Brutti</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=ehhpFjQAAAAJ'>Dr. Gianluca Esposito</a>

- August 2023: I attended the <a href='https://ssw2023.org/'>12th ISCA Speech Synthesis Workshop</a> in Grenoble, France. Preliminary results from my M.Sc. thesis were accepted as a <a href='https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/ssw_2023/fong23b_ssw.html'>late-breaking report</a> and presented as a poster at the workshop.

- September 2022 - October 2023: I was a research intern at the <a href='https://speechtek.fbk.eu/'>Speech Technology Lab</a> at the Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK).
